# Recursion_Math_Lesson_1
This project is the homework of lesson 1 aboout recursion in math and programmming.


Within this project the following assignemts will be resolved with the use of recursive formula's in code.

1. 
Calculate: (1) Pn = 5 * P(n-1) -3, n > 2 
           (2) P1 = 3
           
2.
Calculate: (1) Pn = n * q(n-1), n > 1 
           (2) P0 = 5
           
3.
Determine a recursive definition for sequence: 6, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, ...

4.
Determine a recursive definition for sequence: 1, 2, 7, 32, 157, ...

5.
Determine a recursive definition for sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

6.
Determine a recursive definition for An: the number of dots of n dice (n ≥ 1). Give an explanation.

7.
At a checkers tournament (Dutch: damtoernooi), there are n players. The playing schedule is as follows: each player will play twice against every other player(once with white and once with black).
Determine a recursive definition for 𝑝𝑛: the number of games that will be played in total by n players.
Give an explanation.

8.
This is an additional explination for assignment 7. 
I've added a visualisation excersize and a picture to explain my solution.
